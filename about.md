I am a typical "average Joe". Just like many other "average Joes" I
dreamed of achieving something more than average since I was very
little. Now that I reached a point in my life where many at my age
have come to accept the fact that nothing extraordinary is ever gonna
happen in their lives, I am still stuck in the phase of denial.

If you ain't an "average Joe", you won't understand what it feels like
to be one. You are neither physically attractive nor intellectually superior.
Your habit of procrastination sometimes makes you hate
yourself with a passion. Your perseverance fluctuates at the mediocre
level and you have rarely achieved anything that makes you feel truly
proud of yourself.

One problem of an "average Joe" when he's still in denial of reality
is that he has exactly the same kind of dreams as his exceptional
fellow human beings. Although when he ain't able to convert those
dreams into reality, he most probably will come up with (often lame)
excuses to cover up the actual reasons that are so much more difficult
to admit: lack of discipline, perseverance and perhaps the ability to do
things in a smarter way.

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong to be an "average Joe". In
fact I am not an unhappy person as one of them. However, I am a little
curious about how much a fellow "average Joe" can push
himself. Because if an "average Joe" can do it, most people can do it
as well.

As to myself, I am just hoping to get stuck in the phase of denial a
little longer. I am still learning and will continue to take notes.
