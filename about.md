## Hej!

I am a typical "average Joe". Just like many "average Joe" I dreamed
of achieving something more than average since I was very little. Now
that I reached a point in my life where many at my age have accepted
that nothing extraordinary is ever gonna happen in their lives, I am
still stuck in the phase of denial.

If you ain't an "average Joe", you won't understand what it feels like
to be one. You have neither super attractive appearance nor outstanding
intelligence. Your habit of procrastination sometimes makes you angry
about yourself. Your perseverance fluctuates at the mediocre level and
you have rarely achieved something that make you feel truly proud of
yourself.

One characteristic of an "average Joe" when (s)he still in denial is
that (s)he has exactly the same kind of dreams as those exceptional
fellow human beings. Though for them, when they ain't able to convert
those dreams into reality, there will always be (often lame) excuses for
the actual reasons that are more difficult to admit: lack of
discipline, perseverance and the ability to do things in a smarter
way.

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong to be an "average Joe". But
as one of them, I am a little curious about how much a fellow "average Joe"
can ever achieve. As to myself, I am hoping to get stuck in the phase
of denial just a little longer.
