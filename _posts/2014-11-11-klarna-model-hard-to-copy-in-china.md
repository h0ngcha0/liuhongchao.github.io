title: Hard to have Chinese version of Klarna?
---

About 3.5 years ago when I just started at [Klarna](http://www.klarna.com), I
was wondering if its business model could be replicated in China. The
following is a little note that I had at the time about my naive
perception of Chinese E-commerce in general and online payment in
particular, and the reason why it might be hard.


## The scale and rate of growth
In 2011 Q2, the transaction volume of the online payment is around
456.6 Billion RMB (roughly the same as SEK), increased 117.6% compared
to the same period in 2010 and 25.1% on a quarterly basis. Among that,
e-commerce related online payment volume accounted for around 179.2
Billion RMB, increased 76.7% compared to the same period last year and
10.6% on a quarterly basis. Online payment was especially booming in
the Finance/Logistics/Manufacturing industries as well. [1]

BCG estimated that the transaction volume of the online shopping
business is expected to grow four-fold by 2015 compared to 2010 (where
the annual transaction back then was around 80 Billion USD) [2]

## Main Players and their business compared to Klarna
[Alipay](http://baike.baidu.com/view/1039675.htm) is the dominant
player in the online payment space in China, they claim to have 610M
registered user (as of June, 2011), market share around 50% [1]. It is
one of the subsidiaries of Alibaba group which happens to own China's
biggest B2C/C2C online shop Taobao as well. (similiar to the
eBay-PayPal relationship). Initially Alipay was only intended to serve
as a secure way of payment for Taobao itself, but later they also
introduced a program called "Alipay Open Plan" [3], which allows the
e-stores to integrate with Alipay to use its "Escrow" service [4], in
which Alipay holds the money from the customer until the customer
confirms (s)he is happy about the product before Alipay pays the
e-store. Alipay also supports transferring money between Alipay
account holders. 

When there are disputes between customers and e-stores, Alipay will
not get involved. Customers and the e-store have to contact each other
and settle the dispute by themselves [5]. 

In some cities, users can use Alipay not only for online shopping,
they can do things ranging from paying electricity bills, top up
mobile phone, paying real-estate mortgages, flight/movie tickets, even
lottery and traffic fines. It functions more like a real bank. (a
snapshot). 

Tenpay has around 21% of market share in the online payment industry
in China, making it the 2nd largest player. It's owned by Tencent, the
biggiest internet company in China. The services from Tenpay are
pretty much the same as Alipay. It supports "Escrow" service for
e-stores and money transfer between Tencent account holders as
well. In some cities, people can also use it as personal financial hub
to pay basically all their bills.

Alipay and Tenpay also seem to put in a lot of effort into their
"Enterprise" edition, (maybe like Klarna's company purchase in Sweden)
providing B2B payment solutions for many companies in industries like
Logistics, Manufacturing, Travel/Flight, etc. Alipay and Tenpay also
have "Group Pay" program which allows the integrated e-stores to
support Group Buy. [7] [8]

Both of them even get physical by having their own card (partner with
the real bank).

Other player includes China Unionpay's online business, 99bill, etc. 

AFAIK, there's no company that provides the similar service as
Klarna. Invoice based/Part-payment solution is almost non-existent (i
don't have the data, based on observation), I guess it has to do with
the fact that a nation-wide credit system is not in place and the
fraud and credit risks might be considerably bigger.

## User Behavior
Most of the e-stores in China run on Taobao, Paipai or other e-bay
similar sites whose parent companies happen to run  popular online
payment solutions like Alipay and Tenpay too. They don't usually
integrate with other third party payment solutions. That's one of the
reasons why together these two payment solution account for more than
70% of the market share. PayPal has very limited footprint in China
partly because Ebay lost its battle pretty miserably to Taobao in the
online shopping business in China.

A friend of mine who runs a popular "independent" e-store [10] that
sales tea told me that around 80% of his customers chose to pay on
delivery, which is consistent with the feedback from some of my other
friends. This *probably* indicates that customers in China do really
like the idea of paying after getting the products, so invoice based
solution might be relatively easier for them to adopt. That friend of
mine did integrate with Alipay but he said many of the customers
complained its usability. Online part-payment might not be as popular
as in western countries coz China (and East Asia at large) at this
stage still has a more "saving" oriented culture, but this is
gradually changing as well. 

## Government Regulations
Prior June, 2010. There's no regulations in the space of online
payment industry in China. In June, 2010, the central bank published a
regulation named "the regulations for non-bank companies that operate
in the online payment business" [11]. It lists some of the rules that
the local companies have to comply with to be able the get the
licence. It also states that "the business scope of the foreign online
payment companies, the qualification of the foreign investors as well
as its share of the joint-venture is subject to another regulation,
and it has to be reported to the state council". One year later, the
"other" regulation is still not materialized yet. This forced some of
the third payment companies to restructure their organization,
including Alipay [12]. 

In May, 2011, central bank granted the license to 27 third party
payment companies [13] and there's no foreign companies in the list,
not even PayPal.

## Nation-wide information bureau system and debt collection
The information bureau infrastructure  and the enforcement authority
(including the related laws and regulations) are a lot less developed
as countries like Sweden. The development of the nation-wide credit
system is still in its very early stage. [14]  In some cities or
provinces, like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, etc, there
might be basic credit infrastructure in place but I am not really sure
how good they are. (need more info digging)

## Some thoughts
- Regulation is the immediate problem if foreign 3rd party payment
  provider wants to enter China, but in the long run, the market
  should be more and more open.  Whether there's a way to get around
  this is an open question. 
- Nation-wide operation might not be feasible in the near future due
  to the lack of nation-wide credit lookup and enforcement
  infrastructure. Might be easier to enter the first-line, relatively
  developed cities/provinces. It is unwise to consider China as a single
  market. 
- It might help to start by targeting selected group of people, like
  civil servants, teachers etc, the risk of which should be
  significantly lower. Basically, switch the blacklist model in Sweden
  to a whitelist model. 
- If it is hard to grant customer credits due to the lack of related
  infrastructure, I believe there will be many e-stores who want to sell
  their stuff to the countries where Klarna has operations in (the
  friend that I mentioned in the previous paragraph being one of
  them). Maybe companies like Klarna can enter a country with similar
  situations by only offering e-store integration.
