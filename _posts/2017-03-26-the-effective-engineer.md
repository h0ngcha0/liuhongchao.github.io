I like to listen to talks by interesting people, especially while I was doing housework. I thought I might
as well make a "summary of the talk" (SOTT)" that I felt interesting so that I won't forget it and hopefully it is even
helpful for others.

I will start with a talk called [The Effective Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIz7H5ruy0) by Edmond Lau.
