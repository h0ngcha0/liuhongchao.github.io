title: Launch nioctib.tech
---

Recently I launched [nioctib.tech](https://nioctib.tech), a Bitcoin education site which currently supports searching
and displaying Bitcoin transactions as well as interpreting the locking and unlocking script associated with those transactions.

Couple of Script related things that are supported:

* All the [op codes](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Opcodes) in Bitcoin script.
* [Segregated Witness](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segregated_Witness) transactions.
* Different transactions types, such as [P2PKH](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Pay-to-Pubkey_Hash), [P2SH](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash), [P2WSH](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/#native-pay-to-witness-script-hash-p2wsh)
and [P2WPKH](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/#native-pay-to-witness-public-key-hash-p2wpkh), etc.

Still a lot of room for improvements, for example, address search could be enabled, more information from backend could be presented at the frontend
to help better understand how the transaction is verified. But I hope this could already be helpful for people who want to build a deeper understanding
of how Bitcoin script works.

The intention is that in the future when more script related features are introduced in Bitcoin, such as [Taproot](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-January/015614.html),
[MAST](https://bitcointechtalk.com/what-is-a-bitcoin-merklized-abstract-syntax-tree-mast-33fdf2da5e2f) or [Schnorr signatures](https://bitcointechtalk.com/scaling-bitcoin-schnorr-signatures-abe3b5c275d1),
nioctib could be extended to help people understanding those as well.

Following is a screenshot of the site displaying a [MultiSig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature) [P2SH script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) while it is executed.
