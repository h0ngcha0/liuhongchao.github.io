title: Bitcoin script debugger

Recently I launched a Bitcoin education site called [nioctib.tech](https://nioctib.tech), which right now supports searching and displaying Bitcoin transactions as well as interpreting the locking and unlocking script
associated with those transactions.

All the Bitcoin Script [OpCodes](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Opcodes) are supported. [Segregated Witness](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segregated_Witness) is supported as well.
Still a lot of room for improvements, but I hope this could already be helpful for people who wants to build a deeper understanding of how Bitcoin script works.

Following is a screenshot of the site displaying a [MultiSig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature) [P2SH script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) while it is executed.
