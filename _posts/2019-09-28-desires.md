title: The inevitable divergence of desires
---

If we were to build a race that would survive and prosper within
a dynamic enironment of arbitrary complexity, one of the design
choices we have to make is whether it should be comprised of a finite
number of powerful enough individuals who can last "forever" or a dynamic set
of significantly weaker individuals who can adapt to the environment
through the mechanisms of micro-adjustment and iterations.

If we know all the details of the environment from now until infinity
with all the possible permutations and understand in general how to
build materialistic things that would last forever, designing
individuals that are powerful enough to overcome all the future
adversities might be a viable solution. Unfortunately, neither of
these assumptions are reasonable, therefore designing more adaptive
individuals and maintain the continuity of the race through
iteration is an acknowlegement to the fact that nobody
poccesses perfect information and knows how to build perfect beings,
including God.

How to implement adaptation and interation for a race?
[Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and
[Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) might have
figured something out through reverse engineering over the years, which can offer us
some inspirations. At the race level, we can use genetic mutation as raw material and
iterate upon it through the mechanisms of death and reproduction to achieve
adapation. At individual level, carefully engineered
desires shall be instilled in such a way that their satisifaction
would collectively fulfill the design goals of the entire race without
individuals neccessarily understanding
the connections. In fact, many well engineered systems have achieved
their sophisticated design goals through having "dumb" individuals
interacting with each other within an incentive structure fueled by
individual desires, notable examples include
[mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse), [market
economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy) and
[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).  As the race
designer, how to weave individual desires into an incentive
structure which can help the long term propsperity of the entire race
is the trickiest part of the business. Note that this wouldn't be an
issue had we had the competence to build perfect individuals that can
last forever since in a static system like that, goals are
fundamentally aligned at both individual and race level without
requiring any incentive structures.

With all these said, we should start to appreciate whoever designed
and engineered human being as a race. Since individual demise is
inevitable, the desire for survival is built within us to counteract
that. Sexual desire is also installed to help reproduction. Other
desires are derived directly or indirectly from these two fundamental
desires to form a web of desires, which fundamentally governs our
behaviour. Once we were deployed to the wild, the constant struggling
to satisfy various desires in an adversarial and competitive
environment help foster intelligence, rational thinking and generate
even more desires.
