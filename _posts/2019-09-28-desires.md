title: Divergence of desires

If we were to build a race that would survive and prosper within a
dynamic enironment of arbitrary complexity, one of the design choices
we have to make is whether we should build a finite number of powerful
enough individuals who can last "forever" or start with a dynamic set
of significantly weaker individuals who can constantly adapt to the
environment through the mechanisms of micro-adjustment and iterations.

If we know all the details of the environment from now until infinity
with all the possible permutations and understand in general how to
build materialistic things that would last forever, designing
individuals that are powerful enough to overcome all the future
adversities might be a viable solution. Unfortunately, neither of
these assumptions are true, therefore designing a race comprised
of more adaptive individuals and maintain its continuity through
iteration is a unwilling acknowledgement to the fact that nobody
poccesses perfect information and knows how to build perfect beings.

How to implement adaptation and interation as a race designer?
[Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and
[Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud)'s work over the
years might offer us some inspirations. At the race level, we can use
genetic mutation as raw material and iterate upon it through the
mechanisms of death and reproduction to eventually achieve adapation. At
individual level, carefully engineered desires can be instilled in
such a way that their satisifaction would collectively fulfill the
design goals of the entire race without individuals neccessarily
understanding the connections. In reality, many well engineered systems
have achieved their sophisticated design goals through having "dumb"
individuals interacting with each other within an incentive structure
fueled by individual desires, notable examples include
[mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse), [market
economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy) and
[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).  As the race
designer, how to weave individual desires into an incentive structure
which can help the overall long term propsperity is the
trickiest part of the business. Note that this wouldn't be an issue
had we mastered the competence of building perfect individuals that
last forever, since in a static system like that, goals at individual
and race level are inherently aligned without requiring
any incentive structures.

With all these said, we should start to appreciate the ingenuity and
thoughtfulness that went into the design and engineering of human
being as a race. The desire for survival is built deeply within us to
counteract our inevitable demise, stretching a blank canvas where our
colorful lives are all painted. Reproduction is driven largely by
sexual desire, giving us resilience against the ever changing
environment. A web of desires are derived either directly or
indirectly from these two fundamental desires, which together govern
our behavior. Once we were deployed to the wild, the constant struggle
to satisfy various desires in a competitive and often times
adversarial environment help foster intelligence, rational thinking
and grow even more desires. So far, the prosperity of human being as a
race seems to have proved that those designs worked really well.

However, like many other tools in the repertoire of a race designer,
desire can be a double edged sword with unintended
consequences. For example, one of the more fundamental human desires,
according to [Rene
Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard), is
[mimetic desire](https://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/#H2). We can at least
partially attribute our success as a specie so far to our
significantly better mimetic capability compared to other species,
which is the basic mechanism of learning.

next up:

double edged sword, use mimetic theory as example (mimetic desire). even though human
beings have come up with solutions such as sacrifice and religion, it
is still having unintended consequences.

desire is fundamentally short sighted?

self aware of desire, human are smart enough to manipulate desires now. in the old times it
is through reducing desires (buddism), nowadays people might just
start to do things to satisify it directly, more and more.

desires of an individiual are designed not to have significance to the
future of a race, but if it starts to have effect, then it is an issue
since we are on the path of individual empowerment with asymmetric
technologies, including encryption, neurolink, human enhancement,
cryptocurrency, and portable weapon of mass destruction, etc.

if those things are mastered by a few percentage of the elites, we
will be dead as a race, since it goes beyond the limitation of the
original design, which assumes that the individual capability should
be below a threshhold.

every evolution of environment, there exists an equilibrinm of what is
the optimal level of individual complexity.

tipping point in the history of human beings where this is happening.
