If we were to build a race that would survive and prosper within
a dynamic enironment of arbitrary complexity, one of the design
choices we have to make is whether it should be comprised of a finite
number of powerful enough individuals who can last "forever" or a dynamic set
of significantly weaker individuals who can adapt to the environment
through the mechanisms of death and reproduction.

If we know all the details of the environment from now until infinity
with all the possible permutations and understand in general how to
build materialistic things that would last forever, designing
individuals that are powerful enough to overcome all the future
adversities might be a viable solution. Unfortunately, neither of
these is easy to achieve, therefore designing more adaptive
individuals and maintain the continuity of the race through
iteration is a direct acknowlegement to the fact that nobody
poccesses perfect information and knows how to build perfect things.

How to achieve adaptation and interation for a race?
[Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and
[Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) could give us
some inspirations. We can achieve adaptation through genetic mutation
and interation through death and reproduction. Individuals can be
instilled with carefully engineered desires to achieve these
collective goals without neccessarily knowing their connections. In
fact, many well engineered systems have achieved their sophisticated
design goals through having dumb individuals interacting with each
other within an incentive structure fueled by individual desires,
notable examples include [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse)
and [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy).
For the race designer, the tricky business here is how to engineer the
individual desire in such a way that collectively it always
contributes to the propsperity of the race. Note that this is not an
issue if we had the competence to build perfect individuals that can
last forever since in a static system like this the individual and
collective goals are by design always aligned.

The issue with building powerful and long lasting individuals is that
it is hard to collect all the adversities for the environmts
it is in general very difficult to build anything that would last for
