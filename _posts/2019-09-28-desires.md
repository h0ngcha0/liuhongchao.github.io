If we were to build a race that would survive and even prosper within
a dynamic enironment of arbitrary complexity, one of the design
choices we have to make is whether it should be comprised of a finite
number of powerful individuals who can last "forever" or a dynamic set
of significantly weaker individuals who can adapt to the environment
through the mechanisms of death and reproduction.

If we know all the details of the environment from now until infinity
with all the possible permutations and understand in general how to
build a materialistic thing that would last forever, designing
individuals that are powerful enough to overcome all the future
adversities might be a viable solution. Unfortunately, neither of
these is easy to achieve, therefore designing more adaptive
individuals and maintain the continuity of the race through
interations is an acknowlegement to the fact that nobody poccesses
perfect information and knows how to build perfect things.

The issue with building powerful and long lasting individuals is that
it is hard to collect all the adversities for the environmts
it is in general very difficult to build anything that would last for
a long time.
