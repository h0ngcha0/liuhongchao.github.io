title: The inevitable divergence of desires
---

If we were to build a race that would survive and prosper within
a dynamic enironment of arbitrary complexity, one of the design
choices we have to make is whether it should be comprised of a finite
number of powerful enough individuals who can last "forever" or a dynamic set
of significantly weaker individuals who can adapt to the environment
through the mechanisms of micro-adjustment and iterations.

If we know all the details of the environment from now until infinity
with all the possible permutations and understand in general how to
build materialistic things that would last forever, designing
individuals that are powerful enough to overcome all the future
adversities might be a viable solution. Unfortunately, neither of
these assumptions are reasonable, therefore designing more adaptive
individuals and maintain the continuity of the race through
iteration is an acknowlegement to the fact that nobody
poccesses perfect information and knows how to build perfect beings,
including God.

How to implement adaptation and interation for a race?
[Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and
[Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) might have
figured something out through reverse engineering over the years, which can offer us
some inspirations. At the race level, we can use genetic mutation as raw material and
iterate upon it through the mechanisms of death and reproduction to achieve
adapation. At individual level, carefully engineered
desires can be instilled in such a way that their satisifaction
would collectively fulfill the design goals of the entire race without
individuals neccessarily understanding
the connections. In fact, many well engineered systems have achieved
their sophisticated design goals through having "dumb" individuals
interacting with each other within an incentive structure fueled by
individual desires, notable examples include
[mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse), [market
economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy) and
[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).  As the race
designer, how to weave individual desires into an incentive
structure which can help the long term propsperity of the entire race
is the trickiest part of the business. Note that this wouldn't be an
issue had we mastered the competence of building perfect individuals that
last forever since in a static system like that, goals are
fundamentally aligned at individual and race level without
requiring any incentive structures.

With all these said, we should start to appreciate whoever designed
and engineered human being as a race. The desire for survival is built
within us to counteract the inevitable individual demise, stretching a
blank canvas where we can all paint our colorful lives. Reproduction is
motivated largely by sexual desire. A web of desires can be derived
directly or indirectly from these two fundamental ones, which
together govern our behaviour. Once human beings were deployed to the
wild, the constant struggling to satisfy various desires in an
adversarial and competitive environment help foster intelligence,
rational thinking and generate even more desires. Like many other
tools in race designer's repertoire, desire can be a double edged
sword with unintended consequences. But as long as the collective side
effects of satisfying those individual desires still help with the
continuation of the human beings, 

next up:

double edged sword, use mimetic theory as example (mimetic desire). even though human
beings have come up with solutions such as sacrifice and religion, it
is still having unintended consequences.

desire is fundamentally short sighted?

human are smart enough to manipulate desires now. in the old times it
is through reducing desires (buddism), nowadays people might just
start to do things to satisify it directly, more and more.

desires of an individiual are designed not to have significance to the
future of a race, but if it starts to have effect, then it is an issue
since we are on the path of individual empowerment with asymmetric
technologies, including encryption, neurolink, human enhancement,
cryptocurrency, and portable weapon of mass destruction, etc.

if those things are mastered by a few percentage of the elites, we
will be dead as a race, since it goes beyond the limitation of the
original design, which assumes that the individual capability should
be below a threshhold.

every evolution of environment, there exists an equilibrinm of what is
the optimal level of individual complexity.
