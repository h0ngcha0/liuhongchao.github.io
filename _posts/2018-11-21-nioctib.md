title: Bitcoin script debugger

Recently I launched a Bitcoin education site called [nioctib.tech](https://nioctib.tech), which right now
supports displaying and stepping through Bitcoin script for real Bitcoin transactions. Following is a screenshot of
the site displaying a multi-sig p2sh script while it is being executed.

It supports all the Bitcoin op codes and also supports segwit. There are still a lot of room for improvements,
but I hope this could be helpful for people who really wanna understand how Bitcoin script works.
