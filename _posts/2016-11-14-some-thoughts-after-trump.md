title: Some thoughts after the Trump victory
---

As many people out there, I have strong and bitter feelings towards Brexit and the
Trump victory. I thought it represents a major setback from the globalisation which
have brought so much cultual and economical prosperity into this world. It points to
a gloomy future where people are futhur devided by their race, nationality, religious
belief, sexuality, economic status and so on. Worse still, there doesn't seem to be any
immediate, practical solution for that.

Since then, numerous articles have been written to reflect how we ended up here and speculate what
it means to our future. The point that I am try to make in this blog post is probably already
articulated by someone else. If not, it's most likely due to its absurdity. Nevertheless, I am
just gonna put it out there.

First, we need to ask ourselves what makes a productive, efficient and most importantly, innovative
economy. The answer from most would be how to balance the roles that the goverment and market should play.
I don't pretend to know the anwser for that, but here is what I observe: The most advanced and innovative
economies in USA and Europe are California and Nordics, respectively. California is a deep blue state and
Nordics prides itself with its socicial democracy. This seems to contradict with most people's perception
that left-wing ideologies tend to result in Soviet style disaster, after all, there are so many cases
in history that proved that point. However, there must be something important and intriguing missing from
that picture.

Let's take a closer look at California and Nordics, especially Sweden. As vastly different as they might
seem, the two actually have a lot in common. Both are places for builders: California is the home of Silicon
Valley and Hollyhood. Sweden has the most Fortune 500 companies per capita in the world. Both economies use
high value-added industries to drive growth and are extremely export oriented. Since both economies benefit
enormously from the globalisation, not just from the standpoint of the open market, but in California's case,
from the global talent pool as well, the idea of social diversity, immigration and welfare is much more
entrenched then anywhere else.

One might start to wonder, is this left-wing politics just the consequence a successful economy? I'd like to argue 
that it works in both ways. Paul Graham made an interesting point in his [Hackers and Painters](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006624.do)
book that empathsizes the importance of *empathy* to a hacker. He said: *And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work.*
I think that is true for all types of builders and product oriented companies. If they can't put themselves in
other's shoes, the chance of building a great product is 0. In the context of globalisation, that means
understanding people with different backgrounds at a global scale, and the most effective way to achieve that is to have
a diverse society where people respect and take care of each other. A pure capitalist state can not provide fertile
enough soil to nurture generations of builders.

Of course left-wing ideology garantees nothing, neither does any ideologies. Globalisation is by no means
the music in everyone's ears. It makes competition more fierce by inviting everybody into the game.
California and Sweden are clearly playing well, but it can not be neglected that many less competitive
economies are losing out. Historically, there is nothing surprising about the rise and fall of an economy.
But ever since the emergence of international companies with their capital flowing across the
borders, there is always a tension between them and the countries that they belong to. For many decades,
the western countries as a whole is the builder and net exporter to the rest of the world, somewhat similiar
to what California and Sweden is now. Back then, the interest of the international capital and the
western society are more or less in line with each other. But now when the gap between different parts of a
political entity is enlarged in the face or the competition, the division seems to be inevitable, hence the
Brexit and Trump victory.

Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be a problem with easy fixes. At a time when everyone seems to resort
to xenophobia and protectionism, we really need to see a smart and inspirational solution.
