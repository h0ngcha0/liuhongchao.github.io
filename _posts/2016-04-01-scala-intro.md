Yesterday I gave a talk at the [Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Geats/)
in Gothenburg. It was a lot of fun to discuss functional programming and
object oriented programming with all the Scala geats and how Scala
manage to support both programming paradigms but still manage to keep
everything in a consistent way.

Here is the ascii recording of the talk:
