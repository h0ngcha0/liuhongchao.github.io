title: The Ubiquity of Trilemmas
---

Trilemmas can be found across many disiplines throughout history. One way to express it is that only two of the three favourable options can be chosen at the same time.
It is normally visualized as a triangle where the available options are represented by vertices and
choices represented by edges. For example, in the world of international economics, the famous [impossible trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity)
, as illustrated below, states that among three possible policy positions: "free capical flow", "fixed exchange rate" and "sovereign monetary policy", a country can only take two
at the same time.

Trilemmas are everywhere.
In economics, other than the impossible trinity, [pinker social trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma#The_Pinker_social_trilemma)
says that a society can not be "free", "fair" and "equal" simultaneously. In business, [project management trillema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) argues that
given the options of "fast", "cheap" and "good" one can only pick two when a project is executed. In computing,
[CAP thereom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) suggests that for a distributed data store, "consistency", "availability" and "partition tolerance"
can not be achieved at the same time. In religion, [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Epicurus) logically challenges the existence of
an omnipotent and omnibenevelent god. The ubiquity of these trilemmas begs the question: is there anything fundamental about them? That is what the rest of the post will set out to discuss.

First of all, three is a magic number in many cultures. It is a number that offers a sense of balance and completeness but is still brief enough to be memorized.
Three creates patterns that can be found in many speeches, slogans and concepts. From [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), [Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy),
and [Trias Politica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) to [Yes We Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign#Slogan), [Faster, Higher, Stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols), 
and [Government of the people, by the people, for the people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address).
In fact [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)) is a pretty well researched and documented principle in writing, which explains why when
people attempt to capture and delivery the nuances of a complicated matter, they usually come up with three items to strike the balance between completeness of the subject and effectiveness of the communication.

Secondly, three is also a number where things start to get more sophisticated because internal internal interactions are getting more complicated. In physics, general solution exists for [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem)
where given the initial positions and velocities of two massive objects, the task is to predict their subsequent motions. By contrast, after an additional object is added into the system, the interactions
of gravitational forces among the objects become so complicated that the general solution cease to exist. This is called the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem).
Likewise, favorable options in many trilemmas are often times not independent of each other. The desire to be perceived as complete and balanced means that overlapping is inevitable, analogous to
the "gravitational pull" exhibited by the physical objects. It is very difficult to achieve all three of them simultaneously since the fulfillment of any option is always at the some expense of others.

Thirdly, three also represents a sense of stableness. In fact, triangle is the strongest and most rigid shape in the 2D world. Another way of looking at trilemmas is that if there exists a solution that satisfies
all three options simultaneously, it will be a solution that can be applied in any circumstances all the time while always keeping the situation stable. Obviously this is unrealistic since it ignores the fact that
reality changes constantly which requires solutions with different compromises as time goes by. The triangular representation of a stable solution should instead be constructed with an edge that represents the
implicit reality, together with two edges from the trilemma triangle that carry the right amount of tradeoffs for this version of the reality. Take [CAP thereom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) as
an example, there is no universal solution in the world of databases. The reality that Amazon faces is vastly different from a medium sized company, therefore the
options that Amazon picks when building their distributed data store might make very little sense to others. 

To summarize, trilemma thrives because of its brevity and the ability to represent things in a relatively balanced and complete way. No progress can be made without the implicit reality, which is the missing edge of
all the trilemma triangles.
