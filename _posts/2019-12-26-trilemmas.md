title: The Ubiquity of Trilemmas
---

One way to express trilemma is that only two of the three favourable options can be chosen at the same time.
It is often times visualized as a triangle where the available options are represented by vertices and
choices represented by edges. For example, in the world of international economics, the famous [impossible trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity)
states that among three possible policy positions: "free capical flow", "fixed exchange rate" and "sovereign monetary policy", a country can only take two
at the same time, as illustrated below.

Trilemmas exist across many disiplines and throughout history. 
In economics, other than the impossible trinity, there is also the [pinker social trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma#The_Pinker_social_trilemma)
which says that a society can not be "free", "fair" and "equal" simultaneously. In business, the [project management trillema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) argues that
one can only pick two out of "fast", "cheap" and "good" when a project is executed. In computing,
[CAP thereom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) suggests that for a distributed data store, "consistency", "availability" and "partition tolerance"
can not be achieved at the same time. In religion, [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Epicurus) logically challenges the existence of
an omnipotent and omnibenevelent god. The ubiquity of these statements begs the question: is there something fundamental about the trilemmas?

Three is a magic number in many cultures. It is a number that offers a sense of balance and completeness but is still brief enough to be memorized.
Three creates patterns that can be found in many speeches, slogans and concepts. From [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), [Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy),
and [Trias Politica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) to [Faster, Higher, Stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols), 
[Yes We Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign#Slogan) and Lincoln's [Government of the people, by the people, for the people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address).
In fact [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)) is a pretty well researched and documented principle in writing. When it comes to phrasing the
domain of a problem, there also seems to be a tendency to come up with three items in order to strike a balance between the level of completeness and the effectiveness
to convey the message. To some extent, this explains why we only see dilemmas and trilemmas but not so much "lemmas" with more options.

Three is also a number where things start to get more interesting and complicated. In physics, general solution exists for [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem)
where given the initial positions and velocities of two massive objects, one needs to predict their subsequent motions. By contrast, after an additional object is added into the system, the interactions
of gravitational forces among the objects become so complicated that the general solution cease to exist. This is called the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem).
Likewise, favorable options in many trilemmas are often times not independent of each other. Instead, they exhibit similiar "gravitational pull" towards each other similiar to that of the
physical objects, which means that it is very difficult to reconcile all three of them simultaneously in real life. Also, the desire to be perceived as complete and balanced means that overlapping is inevitable.
Focusing on two options at the same time will leave very little room for the third option, just like what the "project management trilemma" is illustrated below:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project-triangle.svg" alt="project triangle" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 40%;"/>

Three also means stable. In fact, triangle is the strongest and most rigid shape in the two dimentional world. Another way of looking at trilemmas is that if all three favorable options
can be satisified at the same time, then for that particular problem we manage to unrealistically find a stable solution that can be applied in all circumstances. What is missing
from the triangular representation of the trilemma is perhaps the implicit reality, which at certain point in time can probably be used to construct a stable solution together with two of the favourable options.
Since there exist many real life scenarios and each one of them can evolve over time, we need many solutions that can adapt to them with different set of tradeoffs and compromises.
Take [CAP thereom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) as an example, there doesn't exist a universal solution in the world
of databases. The reality that Amazon faces is very different compared to an average medium sized internet company, therefore the
two favourable options that they pick when building their distributed data store might make very little sense to others. 

To summarize, one thing that might contribute to the ubiquity of trilemmas is our tendency to capture a concept with three competing and overlapping properties which are very difficult to reconcile.
What's always missing from trilemma's triangular representation is the implicit reality, without which there will be no way moving forward.
