"That's one small step for (a) man, one giant step for mankind."

When the footprint of a human being was left, for the first time ever,
on the surface of a body other than earth, it not just fulfilled JFK's
promise to put a man on the moon and gave USA a competitive edge in
the race of space technology. The significance of this event
transcends nationalism, race and ideology and makes the entire human
race, for a brief moment, cheer for this magnificent achievement.

There are a few reasons that I like this photograph. First, when we
look back to our history, the differences of our cultures, ideologies
and the levels economical development often foster misunderstanding
and distrust. We tend to focus on our differences with our "enemies"
rather than our similarities. We often let our hatred get its way and
ignore the fact that we are all humans and we want pretty much the
same thing: a happy and purposeful life, a good environment to prosper
and an even better one for our kids. Although this picture is the
by-product of an ideology struggle, it has the power to make people,
disregard of their differences, be proud of their identity as human
beings.
