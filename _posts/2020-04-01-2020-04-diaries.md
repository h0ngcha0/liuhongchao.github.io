[Why Decentralization Isn't as Importatnt as You
Think](https://unchainedpodcast.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/)

Very well articulated article. Decentralization is a mean to the
ends, what really matters is what are we trying to achieve. Bitcoin
is designed as decentralized because the centralized alternatives can
not survive. Decentralized Uber and Twitter, etc do not have that
problem.

Decentralization has a lot in common as democracy and privacy, it is
abstract things that might not have preceived immediate
consequence.

[Coronavirus Second Order Effects and Improving on Bitcoin With
BitTorrent Creator Bram
Cohen](https://www.coindesk.com/coronavirus-second-order-effects-and-improving-on-bitcoin-with-bittorrent-creator-bram-cohen)

Chia's proof of space and time seems to a pretty interesting take on
Nakamoto Consensus. Other than that Bram Cohen talks about some of Chia's
scripting capabilities that allows reflection on transactions,
something that was discussed in [Jeremy Rubin and
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/01/30/jeremy-rubin-3.html).
Generally the concept of
[covenant](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/24752/proof-of-work-a-bitcoin-covenant-proposal),
proof of space and time as well as CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY are worth
looking into.
