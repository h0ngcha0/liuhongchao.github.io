* [Why Decentralization Isn't as Importatnt as You
Think](https://unchainedpodcast.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/)

  Very well articulated article. Decentralization is a mean to the
  ends, what really matters is what are we trying to achieve. Bitcoin
  is designed as decentralized because the centralized alternatives can
  not survive, whereas the centralized version of Uber and Twitter, etc
  already work pretty well.

  Decentralization has a lot in common as privacy and democracy, it is
  abstract concept that might not have perceivable immediate consequence
  at individual level.

* [Is Coronavirus a Challenge to Political Identity with Andreas
M. Antonopoulos -
WBD209](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/is-coronavirus-a-challenge-to-political-identity-with-andreas-m-antonopoulos)

  The world really needs to reflect after this crisis, both the east
  and the west.

* [Coronavirus Second Order Effects and Improving on Bitcoin With
BitTorrent Creator Bram
Cohen](https://www.coindesk.com/coronavirus-second-order-effects-and-improving-on-bitcoin-with-bittorrent-creator-bram-cohen)

  Chia's
  [proof-of-spacetime](https://golden.com/wiki/Proof-of-spacetime_(PoSt))
  seems to be a pretty interesting take on Nakamoto Consensus. Other than
  that Bram Cohen talks about some of Chia's scripting capabilities that
  allows reflection on transactions, something that was discussed in
  [Jeremy Rubin and
  CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/01/30/jeremy-rubin-3.html).
  The general concept of
  [covenant](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/24752/proof-of-work-a-bitcoin-covenant-proposal),
  proof of spacetime and CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY are worth looking into.

* [Sarah Tavel – Consumer & Marketplace Investing – [Invest Like the Best, EP.168]](http://investorfieldguide.com/tavel/)

  Build market place is all about bringing in enough liquidity to
  reach a tipping point. The most sensible thing to do as a new market
  place is to really focus on a niche area and grow from
  there. e.g. Linkedin isn't the type of network that is optimized for
  real estate brokers, which could be a niche where competing network can
  grow.

  Even the most successful hyper growth companies have moments of
  doubts. e.g. When Facebook aquired Instragram and shut Printerest
  down from their feed, it was an existential moment. Stick to the
  first principle and vision, execute is the only way out.
  
  Getting a product right is all about focus, how do you reduce to the
  very core and what is important. How to optimize the features so
  that the ideas of "accrueing benefits" and "mounting loses" are
  baked in product.

* [Episode 405: Yevgeniy Brikman on Infrastructure as Code Best
  Practices](https://www.se-radio.net/2020/04/episode-405-yevgeniy-brikman-on-infrastructure-as-code-best-practices/)

  Key take aways

  - Split big project into small modules, with respective state
    files. Based on logic as well as risk preference
  - Terraform plan output as part of the code review process
  - Reluctance over auto applying terraform changes due to the
    possibility of severe consequences
  - Many reasons for lack of re-usable infrastructure-as-code
    libraries. One reason could be running/maintaining/executing tests
    in this domain are extra expensive. The situation might get better
    as the ecosystem evolves.
