[Why Decentralization Isn't as Importatnt as You
Think](https://unchainedpodcast.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/)

Very well articulated article. Decentralization is a mean to the
ends, what really matters is what are we trying to achieve. Bitcoin
is designed as decentralized because the centralized alternatives can
not survive. Decentralized Uber and Twitter, etc do not have that
problem.

Decentralization has a lot in common as democracy and privacy, it is
abstract things that might not have preceived immediate
consequence.
