- [Why Decentralization Isn't as Importatnt as You
Think](https://unchainedpodcast.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/)

Very well articulated article. Decentralization is a mean to the
ends, what really matters is what are we trying to achieve. Bitcoin
is designed as decentralized because the centralized alternatives can
not survive, whereas the centralized version of Uber and Twitter, etc
already work pretty well.

Decentralization has a lot in common as privacy and democracy, it is
abstract concept that might not have perceivable immediate consequence
at individual level.

The world really needs to reflect after this crisis, both the east and
the west.

- [Coronavirus Second Order Effects and Improving on Bitcoin With
BitTorrent Creator Bram
Cohen](https://www.coindesk.com/coronavirus-second-order-effects-and-improving-on-bitcoin-with-bittorrent-creator-bram-cohen)

Chia's
[proof-of-spacetime](https://golden.com/wiki/Proof-of-spacetime_(PoSt))
seems to be a pretty interesting take on Nakamoto Consensus. Other than
that Bram Cohen talks about some of Chia's scripting capabilities that
allows reflection on transactions, something that was discussed in
[Jeremy Rubin and
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/01/30/jeremy-rubin-3.html).
The general concept of
[covenant](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/24752/proof-of-work-a-bitcoin-covenant-proposal),
proof of spacetime and CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY are worth looking into.
