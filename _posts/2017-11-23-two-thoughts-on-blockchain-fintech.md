title: Two thoughts on Fintech and Blockchain

1) As much as people's initially hope of how decentralized internet should be when it was invented, nowadays we see very centralized services for various reasons (convenience, efficiency, human nature, need for trust) at the same time when it flattens the world as we have never seen before in human history

2) The past 20 years of information decentralization didn't make NY Times obsolete, but the whole news business is hugely transformed with a lot more smaller players enabled by this technological capability. If this can be of any reference in the era of trust/money decentralization, perhaps bank will not be obsolete just as NY Times is, but if an average Joe could set up a bank and you don't need to trust him but the underlying tech, then we will see many average Joes in banking business competing/collaborating with HSBC just as many bloggers are in news business competing/collaborating with New York times.

It is interesting to see how this could shuffle different aspect of the game.
