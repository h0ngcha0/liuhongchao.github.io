Yesterday I gave a talk in the local scala meetup titled [Blockchain with Scala](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Geats/events/255967746/).
A few things were covered and I really enjoyed the discussion.

* The significance of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in general
* Dive into how Bitcoin works, the foundation of all blockchains.
* Verify real Bitcoin transactions in Scala, using [bitcoin4s](https://github.com/liuhongchao/bitcoin4s)
* Zoom out and see how the blockchain framework [Scorex](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/Scorex) generalizes
some of the core concepts of Bitcoin.
