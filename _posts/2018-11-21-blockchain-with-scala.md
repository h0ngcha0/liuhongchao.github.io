Yesterday I gave a talk in the local scala meetup titled [Blockchain with Scala](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Geats/events/255967746/).
It was a lot of fun discussing the significance of the Blockchain technology, how Bitcoin works, how Bitcoin script
gets interpreted during the transaction verification, how [Scorex](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/Scorex)
generalizes some of the core concepts of Bitcoin and Blockchain at large, etc etc.
