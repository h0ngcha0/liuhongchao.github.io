title: Learn You Some Crypto for Good
---

**TL;DR**. We live at a time when states and companies tend to get
more and more powerful at the expense of individual rights, when
government and corporate surveillance becomes the status quo, when
people always have to sacrifice privacy for convenience, when
Keynesian school of economics seems to be kicking the can down the
road all the time. Cryptocurrency and its related technologies can
potentially offer alternatives that make the world a more balanced
place.

In the past few days, the market has crashed hard on basically
everything, including Bitcoin. Financial losses naturally come with
negative emotions and usually clueless justifications. Is coronavirus
really the culprit? Is it the oil war? Or are they just distractions
for something more fundamental? Perhaps most of us will never know
since we don't pocess the higher dimensional insights required to
decode it. Surprisingly, I wasn't that much affected emotionally by
the price this time like the roller coaster feeling I got from 2017
to 2018. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that my growing
appreciation to the crypto space (primarily Bitcoin) over the years
makes it much more than just a financial investment. As someone
works in the IT space, it not only fascinates me on the technical
side, but also serves as a forcing function for me to learn a bit more
about other disciplines such as *politics*, *economics*, *finance* and
*philosophy*, etc. In retrospect, I feel this learning experience is
very rewarding and a journey well worth taking. In this post, I will
try to argue about why learning some crypto during this extraordinary
times is important from three angles: **Importance of Alternatives**,
**Self Sovereignty** and **Facinating Technologies**.

### Importance of Alternatives

People have vastly different perspectives when it comes to crypto
space. For some it is yet another vechicle for financial
speculations. For others, it is an emerging financial infrastructure
that will ultimately disrupt and replace the dysfunctional legacy
one. Many view it as a promising tool that can help disintermediate
third parties and improve efficiency for a range of economic
activities. Others use it as an asymmetric weapon to protect their
privacy in the world of massive corporate and government surveillance,
or even a
[path](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html)
towards [anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism).

It is fair to say that for many dynamic and complex issues, no
solution will be the most optimal one in all scenarios all the time
(aka a "[silver
bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet)"). This can be
applied to many things such as system designs, business models,
environmental issues or even the forms of governments. One mental
model is that complex issues most likely have structures that're
comprised of sub-components interacting with each other in nuanced and
subtle ways. Given that these structures might be constantly evolving
as well, solving them fundamentally requires constantly responding
with different compromises and tradeoffs.

However, at a particular point in time it might seem that a single
solution is dorminating the entire solution space of a problem. One
example is the business model of most of the internet companies
today. By owning users' identity and harvesting users' data through
"free" services, those companies are able to massively profit from
that. With the current state of mainstream technologies this seems to
be inevitable since it is [incentive
compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_compatibility) for
most of the participants in the system. Majority of the users value
convenience and immediate benefits over the low perceived risk that
one day their privacy will be breached. Internet companies will always
be incentivized to accumulate more user data since it could generate
more profit for them. What we end up with are companies that have
amassed so much power that they need to remind themselves "[don't be
evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil)" and most users
are effectively left with little to no alternatives.

We are living in the world of capitalism where wealth and power has
the
[tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century)
to get more and more concentrated, often at the expense of the
individual rights. This trend is certainly not sustainable. What
blockchain technologies bring on to the table, the **decentralization
of trust**, could potentially offer valuable counterbalance to
that. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin offer alternatives to Fiat
currencies. [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization))
can potentially provide other ways to organize economic
activities. [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)
shows the possibility of building more inclusive and efficient
alternative financial
systems. [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) promises a
competing ownership and incentive structure that could hopefully fix
some of the privacy and data concentration issues of the existing
status quo. For many people, maybe the idea of anarchism is never
about actually realizing it but always about reminding us that
there exists alternatives. If we shoot for the star, we might land on
the moon.

### Self Sovereignty

[Self sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership) is
the idea that people should have ownership and control over their own
bodies, time, properties and responsibilities. It is at the core of
many political philosophies that underlines
[individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism). Self
sovereignty is important since it is essential to personal freedom,
self determination and liberty. On the other hand, the forming of societies or
any other artificial combinations means that individuals need to
surrender part of their self sovereignty to the collective goal
of the group, which in many case are actually beneficial both personally and
as a whole. After all, humans are by nature incentive driven social
animals that try to survive as a race. There are many literatures
about the relationship between individualism and
[collectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism), but it is
fair to say that it's a spectrum rather than binary.

Even though the absolute individualism is perhaps neither desirable
nor possible, it has become much more difficult to exercise one's self
soverignty as governments and corporations are making great strides to
capture it for their own benefits. Nowadays, we need trust and
permissions to use our own identity, our own data and to transact with
our own
money. [Consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism) and
the culture of debt also lure people into sacrificing their long term
freedom for instant gratification, therefore perpetuating the
deprivation of self sovereignty and [social
stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification).

As digital bearer asset, Bitcoin offers a technology and network that
enables and encourages self sovereignty of money. [Andreas
Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/) famously coined the term "[not
your keys, not your
coins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcrEEnDLm58)". Holding your own
private keys is the first step towards self-sovereignty in Bitcoin
since it cryptographically ensures your property rights to your
coin. This of course comes with a lot of responsibilities as well
since if the key is lost, your coin will be lost forever. [Running a
full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node) is the next step. It not
only contributes to the overall consensus of the network, but also
gives you the ultimate self-sovereignty within the network since you
don't need to trust any one else when it comes to what happened to
your coins or ask for permission as to what will happen to your
coins. Even though Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were painted as
magical internet money that's used by criminals to buy drugs on the
darknet, or a ponzi scheme that will burst at any point in time, what
really happened in the past 10 years is that it managed to create a
global wealth pool of hundreds of billions of dollars that are
borderless and censorship resistent, which helps dissidents in
rogue states take a piece of their self sovereignty back and be
more likely to fight against the corruption and tyranny knowing that
they can take their wealth and move somewhere else by just remembering
a bunch of English words.

Bitcoin also encourages a culture that promotes low [time
preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference) and
[delayed
gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification). As
a sound money and store of value, the long term price of bitcoin is
generally expected to rise over time against the constantly inflating
fiat currencies despite of the short term volatilities. When money
actually keeps or increases in value, it encourages saving and
re-investment instead of debt and immediate spending. This shift in
mindset might be the key to get us out of the current situation where
the economy is powered by over-consumption, debt with artificially low
interest rate and quantitive easing.


[Self sovereign
identity](https://medium.com/metadium/introduction-to-self-sovereign-identity-and-its-10-guiding-principles-97c1ba603872)
 and the [processing of encrypted
 data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) also
 attract a lot of research and development to combat the encroachment
 of privacy. I do think a lot more work needs to be done in this area
 to really change the consumer behavior, not only in terms of
 technology but also inventive engineering, to really put the
 sovereignty of identity and personal data back to the users.

### Fascinating Technologies

Blockchain is fascinating from the technical perspective. It was
invented to solve the [double spend
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending) in a
decentralized setting without requiring a trusted third party. It
achieves that with the interplay of two components: **First**, a
modification resistent data structure to store all the
transactions. It turns out that an efficient implementation is to
organize transactions into a sequence of blocks, each of which contains
a cryptographic hash of the previous one, resulting a chain of blocks,
hence the name *blockchain*. **Second**, a method to reach consensus among a
set of networked computers of certain topology as to who should have
the right to append the next block onto the blockchain, called a
[consensus
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)).

A key contribution of Bitcoin as the first blockchain is that an
incentive structure is built right into the consensus algorithm
through the use of [proof of
work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), which coordinates
the economic activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem of miners, merchants,
engineers, exchanges, users, etc. The result is the world's first
[dencentralized autonomous
organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization).
This is a significant milestone in computer engineering. It is the
first time engineers can **program trust and incentives** without
relying on any centralized entity (even for the "money"), which basically
gives engineers the power of genesis creation in whatever
"world" they want to create. Consensus algorithm is an active area
of research in the crypto space, with a lot of thought provoking debates and
exploration.  The most notable alternative to proof of work to achieve
[byzantine fault
tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) is various
forms of [proof of
stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake).

There many other difficult technical problems in the crypto space. One
of them is blockchain **scalability**, which is hard to achieve
without also sacrificing its **security** and **decentralization** properties
(see [scalability
trilemmas](https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-down-the-scalability-trilemma/)).
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)'s response to that seems to be
leveraging clever constructions of [proof of
stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) and
[sharding](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/sharding/),
while the answer from the Bitcoin community at the moment is mostly
second layer solutions such as [Lightning
Network](https://lightning.network/). In recent years, solutions based
on [zero-knowledge
proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) such as
[ZK-Rollups](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/)
were also proposed as a scalability solution. In general, since the
value proposition of a
blockchain is security and decentralization, sacrificing too much of
these properties is generally not desirable (e.g. [blocksize
debate](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy)).

**Privacy** is another important area of research & development
in the space. [Satoshi
Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) famously
said in the Bitcoin [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
that *The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be
aware of all transactions*. There is always a tension between making
everything publicly verifiable and the need for obfuscation.  Bitcoin
does not have good privacy built into the protocol layer, [many
technologies](https://hongchao.me/bitcoin-privacy/) have been explored
to improve that ever since its inception. Other blockchains try to
introduce certain privacy features into the protocol
layer. [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/), for example, leverages
[ring signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature) to
obfuscate the transaction graph and [confidential
transaction](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt) to
hide transaction amount. [Zcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zcash)
uses [zk-SNARKs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof)
to make all of its *shielded* transactions completely private. Both of them
sacrifice scalability to a certain degree and have more
cryptographic assumptions than Bitcoin. [Mimblewimble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MimbleWimble)
also uses confidential transactions to hide the transaction amount, but
through a mechanism called
[cut-through](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/intro.md#cut-through),
it keeps the blockchain very compact thus achieves
privacy and scalability at the same time (scalability is more nuanced
due to the ever growing transaction kernel). Zero knowledge proofs is
another approach that can potentially improve both the privacy and
scalability. Zcash focuses primarily on privacy, but projects like
[Coda](https://codaprotocol.com/) and [zkSync](https://zksync.io/)
are developed with both privacy and scalability in mind.

**Programmability** is also an area of contention in the crypto
space. Bitcoin's [scripting](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) system
allows the creation of [smart
contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) and is
purposefully not turing complete to avoid the [halting
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). It is still
fairly powerful, as demonstrated by the development of lightning
network in the past few years. This design choice is very much
in line with the philosophy where blockchain is [not for computation
but for
verification](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1427885.msg14601127#msg14601127).
Even though Bitcoin script is intentionally kept simple,
there are still many improvements making their way into the language, such as [Schnorr
signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature),
[Taproot](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-January/015614.html) and
[Graftroot](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-February/015700.html),
etc. Things like [Miniscript](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) are
also invented to making writing Bitcoin script easier. 
On the other hand, Ethereum is the first among many blockchains
to offer a turing complete programming language. The idea is to enable
developers to
easily express and execute any programs across all the nodes in
the network to make them "unstoppable". This expressiveness does come
with many tradeoffs: A fee model now needs to be developed for
computational resources on the platform. The blockchain usually gets a lot bigger as a
general purpose computing platform, affecting its scalability and
decentralization properties. A "user friendly" turing complete language
potentially opens up much larger attack surface and is much easier to
be abused. Neverthelss, these dApps platforms have certainly attracted a
lot of the developer mindshare and we start to see applications
especially in the [DeFi](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/defi)
space start to gain momentum. Zero knowledge proof is also a promising
direction when it comes to programmability since computation can now
be done offchain, with a proof of its correctness submitted onchain
for verification. This might point to a future where blockchain
becomes a zero knowledge proof verification engine and the program can
be written in any language that generates the proofs.

Crypto also offers a set of unique challenges when it comes to
**software engineering**. Deploying software updates in a decentralized
p2p network is very difficult, especially when consensus over a shared
state needs to be maintained by different versions of the software at
the same time (see
[Forkology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpeceXY1QBM)). When money
is quite literally on the line and the cost of introducing and fixing
bugs could be extremely high, [move fast and break
things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Inc.#History) is
definitely not an option. In fact, the development of systems such as
Bitcoin should go through the same level of scrutiny and testing as
aerospace software and its deployment should be analogous to shipping
hardware. [Formal
verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification), a
technique that hasn't seen much adoption in many software projects due
to its formidable cost, becomes much more economically feasible in
crypto space considering the amount of value at
stake. [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com/), for example, [formally
verified](https://security.makerdao.com/formal-verification) all the
core contracts in its MCD system.

This is just a tip of an iceberg. We have also seen the basic research
of **cryptography**, which is one of the building blocks of
blockchain, made a lot of progress in the past 10 years because of the
crypto industry, especially in areas such as Zero Knowledge Proofs,
[Multi-party
computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation),
[Verifiable Delay Functions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf) and
[Homomorphic
encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption),
etc. Other difficult challenges include the [oracle
problem](https://medium.com/@DelphiSystems/the-oracle-problem-856ccbdbd14f),
the design of [governance
models](https://watsonlaw.nl/en/blockchain-governance-what-is-it-what-types-are-there-and-how-does-it-work-in-practice/)
and more. Crypto is inherently multi-disciplinary, which means that
even a seemingly pure technical change might butterfly effect its way
into causing significant consequences, which makes the problem extra
interesting and challenging.

<br/>

**In summary**, learning crypto to a certain degree changes the way
that I experience and interact with the world. I feel it is an
experiment that could be leveraged to potentially do good for
the society by providing a balancing force to a lot of the social
economical problems that we have right now.
