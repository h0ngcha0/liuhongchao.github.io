title: Thoughts on Ralph Merkle's "DAO Democracy"
---

The legendary scientist Ralph Merkle talked about his paper "DAO democracy" in a Epicenter
podcast around 2 years ago, and the episode was re-posted this summer when all the Epicenter
hosts were travelling at the same time. As the result, I listened to this episode three times
and really enjoyed it.

In light of the Trump election and Brexit at the time, the core of Ralph Merkle's thesis
was that democracy in the current shape and form is flawed because people are either not
qualified or not incentivised to make quality assessment of the situation. One better way is to
harness the intellectual ability of the bright people without letting them take over too much
power. His proposed solution is to leverage prediction market.

Using election as example, instead of throwing upon average citizens the intellectual burden of
evaluating if a candindate could become a good president, a series of prediction markets can be
established to predict the rating of each the candindates in 4 years if they were to become president.
Bright people, incentised by the potential financial gains (or loss if proven wrong) in the
prediction market, would try to do their best job figuring out which candindate would make ordinary
folks happy in 4 years. Every year, average Joes would only vote for the stuff that they are familiar
with: are things going well in your life. The outcome of the election would entirely based
on the result of the prediction market now.

There are more nuances to the design, but this is the gist of it.

As an elite scientist, Ralph Merkle obviously doesn't believe in one person one vote kind of democracy.
The legendary strategist Lee Kuan Yew had expressed similiar opinions. But instead of going down the
path of assigning weights to each vote  that more informed people would make a bigger impact in the
election, Merkle's design does that implicitly reducing the complexity of individual voting to something
that everybody is qualified to answer, collectivly, the outcome of the voting could be used to answer very
sophiscated questions. Couple that an incentive structure to encourage bright people make the best future 
estimation using prediciton market,  well as a DAO to enforce transparency of the entire process, it seems
to be a reasonable replacement democracy in the current form, at least on paper.

There seems to be something very special about limiting the role of individuals to something very dumb but
collectively achieving meaningful goals. Proof of work in Bitcoin is a typical example: each mining machine is
just computing pointless hash values but as a whole it secures the entire network. One could make the same
argument to animal reproduction mechanisms. Perhaps the reason that many things work brilliantly at the macro
level is because they are stupidly simple at the micro level. It does feel like this pattern captures something
very fundamental, but I am yet to find a way to articulate it. For me, this is the most interesting point in
Merkle's paper.

However, I don't think this design is game theoretically sound. First off, use election as an example, the 
economic benefit of becoming the president is potentially huge, to the extent that "bright people" might be
willing to take a loss to make the wrong prediction in the prediction market, because they are compensated 
in some other ways. For this to work, the money at stake need to be huge. Secondly, who should be the expert?
The easy answer is whoever put their money where their mouths are. This doesn't take into account people's
pride. No one wants to be perceived as dumb. This could as well become a public gambling fest. Last but not
least, prediction market has the problems of perverting the original incentives. Election is supposed to be
an idealogical process, with financial implications, one might vote for someone purely out of finacial interests
rather really believing in the candindate.

Still, very interesting topic, tought provoking discussion, highly recommend to listen to the entire episode.
