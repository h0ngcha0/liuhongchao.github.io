There is a reason why `flatMap` and its cousin `map` deserves a special place in the Scala folklore. It all starts from the [combinator pattern](https://wiki.haskell.org/Combinator_pattern) popularized by the functional programming paradigm, which according to its definition, is "a style of organizing libraries centered around the idea of combining things". Usually, there are a few ways to construct some primitive values of type `T` and a few `combinators` (functions) which can combine values of type `T` to build up more complex values of type `T`. Proponents of the combinator pattern argue that it promotes modularity and composibility of the program.

Many real world libraries are built using the combinator pattern, including the collection and [parser combinator](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.3/scala-parser-combinators/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html) in the Scala standard library, [Dataset](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.html) in Spark, [Queries](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.1/queries.html) in Slick, and a lot more.

As someone who tries to leverage the combinator pattern, the challenge is to come up with both the type `T` and a set of combinators for `T` to encapsulate whatever computation that the author wants to express. If the computation happens to be sequential by nature, that is where `Monad` comes in handy.

There might be a lot of fuzz about `Monad`, but it is not much more than a kind of `T` with a few pre defined `combinator` interfaces. At a high level, it allows us to 1) write a description of a computation and 2) have a away to apply a pure function to the result of the previous computation and transforms it into the description of the next computation. With these two things at our disposal, we can then write programs by taking an initial description of the computation and applying a series of these pure functions. The way of applying those pure functions is `flatMap`.

In fact, so many computations are sequential by nature that `Monad` becomes the basis of many types that tries to leverage the combinator pattern, to the point where languages provides syntactic sugar for it. In Scala, it is the keyword `for`.
