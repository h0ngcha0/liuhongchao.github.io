When Mao lead the revolution, majority of the peasants who played the decisive role were more interested in land redistribution than communism.

When genes were passed on from one generation to the next, most of the individuals involved were driven by their sex urges instead of the mission to continue their species.

When decentralized consensus was made possible for the first time ever in human history through Blockchain, it was merely the by product of all the participants acting for their own interests.
