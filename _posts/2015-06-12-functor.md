![Functor](https://adit.io/imgs/functors/fmap_apply.png)

Often when we learn things, our perception of how much the subject
matter is understood fluctuates. That is pretty much what happens
with my experience with *Functor*.

For a long time I thought *Functor* is just a fancy way of referring
to *mappable* objects. A notable example is list. We can apply a
function to each of the element in the list by mapping that function
to it. As a matter of fact this really is how functor is defined in
[scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/series/7.1.x/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Functor.scala#L20).

Later I came to realize that on top of that there are two laws that
every *Functor* has to obey, namely *identity* and *associative* law,
which basically means that if we map an identity function to a `Functor`
it has to remain the same and that a series of maps can be rewritten
as just one map with one composed function. The following code snippet
from `scalaz` tells the full story:

{% highlight scala %}

trait FunctorLaw {
  /** The identity function, lifted, is a no-op. */
  def identity[A](fa: F[A])(implicit FA: Equal[F[A]]): Boolean =
    FA.equal(map(fa)(x => x), fa)

  /**
   * A series of maps may be freely rewritten as a single map on a
   * composed function.
   */
  def associative[A, B, C](fa: F[A], f1: A => B, f2: B => C)(
    implicit FC: Equal[F[C]]
  ): Boolean =
     FC.equal(map(map(fa)(f1))(f2),map(fa)(f2 compose f1))
}

{% endhighlight %}

That is great, until recently I read a little bit about *category theory*
and notice that in the category of smaller categories, *Functor* refers to
the morphism that turns one category into another category. By definition,
the transformation by the *Functor* should keep the structure of the
category, which consists of three parts: objects, morphisms and some
sort of internal structure. This is not that easy to digest, but.. after
a while it kinda sinks in.

But wait, is the *Functor* in *category theory* somehow connected to
the one we talked about in the context of functional programming? If
it is, how can we interpret this fancy of referring to *mappable objects*
with its corresponding definition in *category theory*? hmmmm...

Gladly this is answered rather clearly
[in the Haskell Wikibook on Category
Theory](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Category_theory#Functors_on_Hask).
Basically if we think of the types of any functional language as a
category (let's use *T* to denote that) and *Functor[T]* as another
category (which is a subset of the category *T*). Then *Functor* can
be seen as a morphism that transforms the former category to
later. Since the map function of the *Functor* has following
signature:

{% highlight scala %}

def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]

{% endhighlight %}

It essentially turns a function *X* of *A => B* to a function *Y* of *F[A] =>
F[B]* therefore effectively transformed *X*, which is the morphism in
the category of *T*, to *Y*, which is the morphism of category
*Functor[T]*.

Interesting. :)
