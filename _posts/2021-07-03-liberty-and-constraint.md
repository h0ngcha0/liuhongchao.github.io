In [The Shawshank
Redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption),
[Brooks Hatlen](https://shawshank.fandom.com/wiki/Brooks_Hatlen) was
released from the prison after being locked up for 50 years. He
finally regained his liberty and yet his inability to adjust to the
outside world gives him constant fear and desperation. He commited
suicide. The freedom from the constraints of the prison killed
him. Similiarly, after [Booker
T. Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington) was
emancipated as a slave, his initial rejoicing was soon overwhelmed by
the sense of deep gloom due to the realization that without money,
education, skills and property, life is not significantly different
after liberation.

Instead of drowning in desperation, Booker spent his life promoting
education, hard work and material prosperity among the
blacks. Ultimately, without a fairer access to education, health care,
security and other social rights, liberty would be an empty slogan for
a large portion of the population. However, enforcing those social
rights requires the redistribution of wealth and resources, therefore
inevitably infringing the liberty of other portion of the
population. The balance of this tension is one of the most important
topics in the debate between liberals and conservatives in
contemporary politics. 

An important question to answer when discussing constraints
and liberties is **who are we optimizing for**. The goal of most of the
societies is to promote long term freedom and happiness of the
entire population. [Isaiah
Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Berlin) articulated in
his essay [Two Concepts of
Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Concepts_of_Liberty) about
the idea of [negative
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty) and [positive
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty) liberty. With only
negative liberty, which focuses primarily on the freedom from
interference by other people, the collective liberty and happiness can
neither be maximized nor fairly distributed. As a balancing force,
positive liberty emphathizes the importance of population's collective
capacity to act upon their free will, which can be achieved by
applying certain constraints to the society. In that sense, negative
liberty alone constrains the society from reaching its full potential,
whereas proper constraints at the right level librate society at
large.

Constraints and liberties seem to have similiar dynamics at smaller
scale as well. For example, without the constraints of the rules, the
game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) will not be able
to librate the mind-blowing creativities from the players. The limited
form of expression offered by the likes of Tiktok, Twitter and WeChat
seems to have unleashed the creativity from their users and therefore
created more sticky networks. Often times, less is more, constraint is
liberty. This probably has to do with our **limited mental capacity**
as human beings. Constraints abstract things away, sometimes at the
expense of choice, but as a tradeoff we get to focus our precious
cognitive effort somewhere else. This is not to say all constraints
are well designed. Countless games must have been invented throughout
history, the set of constraints Go offers stood the test of time.

Another example is programming languges. C is a great language for
system programming with very little constraints, but at the same time
it is also a double edged sword that can cut both ways. People who
mastered the language (e.g. [Linus
Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)) might feel
that [nothing is better than
C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYvJPra7Ebk). However, for many
programmers, having to worry about the countless traps and pitfalls of
C severely limits their capabilities to create. Many languages try to
fix this by enforcing different constraints. One example is functional
programming, where mutation of variables are strongly discouraged or even
disallowed. As it turns out, programmers' creativity are liberated by
these types of constraints because now their cognative energy can be spent
more on solving the actual problems. In general, when we
are trying out different ways of working, we are applying different
constraints and see which one yields the best result. Liberty in the
context of work usually constrains our ability to perform.

Constraint and liberty are also **multifaceted**. Event at the
individual level, one freedom might come at the cost of another. The
constraint of being monitored by the surveillance camera might give
you the freedom to walk around safely at 2am anywhere in the city. The
unregulated freedom of speech in the age of information explosion
could significantly constrain your freedom to understand the truth due
to the asymmetric cost to prove false information. Financial freedom
at certain age might require very displined life style and prudent
management of wealth at earlier age. The liberty to smoke many packs
of cigerettes a day could deprive of any other freedom you might have
the chance to enjoy prematurely.
