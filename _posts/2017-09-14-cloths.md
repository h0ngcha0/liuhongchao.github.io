Often times, a discussion about the politics in certain country winds up being a finger pointing game. Few examples:

>* The Western democracy are just illutions created by hypocrites to oppress and exploit the developing countries.
>* There no absolute freedom of speech.
>* Rule of law? Rich people can get away with murder in the USA.
>* ...

I am sure books can be written to prove that those are not rootless accusations. I wanna throw my 2 cents on this using the
metaphor of clothes.

Political systems are like clothes. Choosing a cloth at a specific point in time can depend on the combination of many (not limited to) of the follow things:

> personality, educational background, taste, self-confidence, figure, mood, financial situations, weather, culture, season, special occation, self identity, functional, fashion, ...

It would be very boring to require everyone wearing the same clothes, and there is no such cloth that can fit everyone. As long as clothes can cover up the genitals it will be fine, because despite of
the differences, that is the minimal level of consensus that people have reached.

The problem is that, sometimes a person with genitals exposed defends himself by arguing that a girl is wearing too short of a skirt. It is not about how much one wears, but if the mandatory piece are worn.
