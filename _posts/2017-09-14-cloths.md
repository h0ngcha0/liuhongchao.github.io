title: Clothes v.s. Politics
---

Political systems are like clothes. It is impossible to compare clothes without considering wearer's personality, culture, education, taste, self-confidence, figure, mood, financial situations, identity as well as the current climate, occation, purpose, trend, etc. It would be ridiculous to ask everyone to wear the same cloth at the same time because there are just too many constantly changing variables.

However, at this point in time in our history, the basic consensus exists, which is that the clothes should at least cover the genitals or else it will be culturally disturbing. When a person with genitals exposed tries to justify himself by pointing fingers at some bikini wearing girls. He missed the point that it is not about who wears less but who have broken that minimal consensus.
