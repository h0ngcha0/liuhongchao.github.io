Often times, a discussion about Chinese politics winds up being a finger pointing game. Few examples:

> The Western democracy are just illutions created by hypocrites to oppress and exploit the developing countries.

> There no absolute freedom of speech.

> Rule of law? Rich people can get away with murder in the USA.

I am sure books can be written to prove that those are not rootless accusations. I wanna throw my 2 cents using the
metaphor of clothes.

Political systems are like clothes. Choosing a cloth at a specific point in time can depend on the combination of the follow things (not limited to):

personality, educational background, taste, self-confidence, figure, mood, financial situations, weather, culture, season, special occation, self identity, functional, fashion, ...


It would be very boring and unreasonable to require everyone wearing the same clothes, and there is no such cloth that can fit everyone.
