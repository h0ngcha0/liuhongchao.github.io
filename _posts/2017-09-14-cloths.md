Often times, a discussion about the politics in certain country winds up being a finger pointing game. Examples:

>* The Western democracies are just illutions created by hypocrites to oppress and exploit the developing countries and their own people.
>* There is no absolute freedom of speech.
>* Rule of law is a joke, rich people can get away with murder in the USA.
>* ...

Political systems are like clothes. It is next to impossible to compare clothes without considering wearer's personality, culture, education, taste, self-confidence, figure, mood, financial situations, identity as well as the current climate, occation, purpose, trend, etc. It would be ridiculous to ask everyone to wear the same cloth because there are just too many constantly changing variables.

However, at this point in time of our history, the basic consensus is that at least the genitals need to be covered to avoid being culturely disturbing. When a person with genitals exposed tries to justify himself by arguing the skirts of some girls are too short. He completely missed the point that it is not about who wears less but rather who have broken that minimal consensus.
