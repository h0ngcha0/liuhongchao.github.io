title: Scala, the startup way

My colleague Marcus Lönnberg and myself gave a talk at the [Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Geats/)
today titled `Scala, the startup way`. We structured the talk with the idea from the exellent presentation
[On the spectrum of abstractions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVVNJKv9esE) given by Cheng Lou a few months ago,
to reason about making technical decisions such as asynchrous programming models, dependency injection, data types,
CRUD vs Event sourcing, kubectl vs our in house testing environment tools, etc. It was an inspiring night with a lot
of insightful discussions with all the Scalaentusiaster.

The slides of the presentation can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/marcuslonnberg/scala-the-startup-way).
