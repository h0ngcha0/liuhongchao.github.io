title: Scala, the startup way

My colleague Marcus LÃ¶nnbergy and myself gave a talk at the [Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Geats/)
today titled `Scala, the startup way`. We structured the talk with the idea from the exellent talk
[On the spectrum of abstractions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVVNJKv9esE) given by Cheng Lou a few months ago,
to reason about making technical decisions such as asynchrous programming models, dependency injection, data types,
CRUD vs Event sourcing, kubectl vs our in house testing environment tools, etc. It was a wonderful night with great
discussions with all the Scalaentusiaster.
