title: A bitcoin library
---

One of the nice things about living in Sweden is the "pappaledighet" (parental leave). In the last two months I took that and had a lot of fun spending time with my lovely son Filip. But when he is asleep, I worked on a small Bitcoin library to help myself understanding the intricacies of this amazing technology. After diving deeper into the blockchain space since March this year, I recognized more and more its potential to disrupt many areas in our society for great good simply because it offers a very scarse commodity: the *dicentralised trust*.

The name of the library is [Bitcoin4s](https://github.com/liuhongchao/bitcoin4s). The plan is to develop the basic [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Scalability&redirect=no#Simplified_payment_verification) functinalities and expose APIs so that it would be possible to build a client to show how bitcoin works internally in greater details.
