title: A Bitcoin library
---

One of the nice things about living in Sweden is the "pappaledighet" (parental leave). In the
last two months I took that and had a lot of fun spending time with my lovely son Filip. But
when he is asleep, I worked on a small Bitcoin library to help myself understand the intricacies of
this amazing technology. After diving deeper into the blockchain space since March this year, 
I am gradually convinced of its potential to advance our societies because of one thing it enabled
which was never possible before: **dicentralised trust**.

The name of the library is [Bitcoin4s](https://github.com/liuhongchao/bitcoin4s). The plan is to develop
the basic [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Scalability&redirect=no#Simplified_payment_verification) functionalities
and expose APIs so that it would be possible to build a client to show how bitcoin works internally with greater details.

Edit (2018-12-01):

Currently, [nioctib](https://nioctib.tech) is built as client to [Bitcoin4s](https://github.com/liuhongchao/bitcoin4s) to show
how Bitcoin script works.
