One way to express trilemma is that only two of the three favourable options can be chosen at the same time.
It is often times visualized as a triangle where the available options are represented by vertices and
choices represented by edges. For example, in the world of international economics, the famous [impossible trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity)
states that among three possible policy positions: "free capical flow", "fixed exchange rate" and "sovereign monetary policy", a country can only take two
at the same time, as illustrated below.

Trilemmas exist across many disiplines and throughout history. 
In economics, other than the impossible trinity, there is also the [pinker social trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma#The_Pinker_social_trilemma)
which says that a society can not be "free", "fair" and "equal" simultaneously. In business, the [project management trillema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) argues that
one can only pick two out of "fast", "cheap" and "good" when a project is executed. In computing,
[CAP thereom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) suggests that for a distributed data store, "consistency", "availability" and "partition tolerance"
can not be achieved at the same time. In religion, [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Epicurus) logically challenges the existence of
an omnipotent and omnibenevelent god. The ubiquity of these statements begs the question: is there something fundamental about the trilemmas?

Three is a magic number in many cultures. It is a number that offers a sense of balance and completeness but is still brief enough to be memorized.
Three creates patterns that can be found in many speeches, slogans and concepts. From [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), [Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy),
and [Trias Politica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) to [Faster, Higher, Stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols), 
[Yes We Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign#Slogan) and Lincoln's [Government of the people, by the people, for the people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address).
In fact in writing, [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)) is pretty well researched and documented. When it comes to phrasing the
domain of a problem, there also seems to be a tendency to come up with three items in order to strike a balance between the level of completeness and the effectiveness
to convey the message. To some extent, this explains why we only see dilemmas and trilemmas but not "lemmas" with more options.

Three is also a number where things start to get more interesting and complicated. In physics, general solution exists for [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem)
where given the initial positions and velocities of two massive objects, one needs to predict their subsequent motions. By contrast, after an additional object is added into the system, the interactions
of gravitational forces among the objects become so complicated that the general solution cease to exist. This is called the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem).
Likewise, favorable options in many trilemmas are often times not independent of each other. Instead, they exhibit similiar "gravitational pull" towards each other similiar to that of the
physical objects, which means that it is very difficult to balance all three of them simultaneously in real life. Also, the desire to be perceived as balanced and complete means that overlaps are inevitable,
Focusing on two options at the same time will leave very little room for the third option, just like what the "project management trilemma" is illustrated below:

Three also means stable. In fact, triangle is the strongest and most rigid shape in the two dimentional world. Another way of looking at trilemmas is that if all three favorable options
can be satisified at the same time, then for that particular problem we manage to unrealistically find a stable solution which can be applied in all circumstances. What is missing
from the triangular representation of the trilemma is perhaps the implicit reality, which at certain point in time together with two of the favourable options can be used to construct a stable solution.
Since many real life scenarios exist and each one of them can evolve over time, we need many solutions that can adapt to the realities with different set of tradeoffs and compromises.






we have the [energy trillema](https://www.worldenergy.org/publications/entry/world-energy-trilemma-index-2019) and

another angle of looking at it
3. three is stable, if we can have it then it can be applied universally, we have a missing implicit edge
4. going backward

compromise. hard choices
complete has to contradict, overlap with each other.

Two dimentional world. Triangles are the most stable shape, very rigid. Hard to achieve triangles, three
bodies problem is probably related to it.

in three dimentional space, all convex polyhedra are stable

the two things forces the third thing to be impossible, because
together with the context, it is not a stable system.
context is not stable.

dilemma is an either/or situation, might be false dilemma (grey area)

Three-body problem is "the problem of taking the initial positions and
velocities of three point masses and solving for their subsequent
motion according to Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of
universal gravitation". Unlike two-body problem, no general
closed-form solution exists, as the resulting dynamical system is
chaotic for most initial conditions, and numerical methods are
generally required. 

something is at the expense of something else. with the invisible
context. the fourth one actually make it not stable any more.

Is there always an invisible context? Are those "lemmas" just the tip
of an iceberg? Without the context, it is very hard to debate it. But
at the same time, those statement should be applied  in general,
meaning that a case by case examination is not really that great ....
are delimmas the conflict introduced by the lack of context and it's
urge to be applied universally?

Democracy, dictatorship, 

Applying a theory to reality, what should be taken into consideration?

why balance, why Tao is kind of important? balance? chaotic system?
