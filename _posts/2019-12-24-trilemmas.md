One way to express trilemma is that only two of the three favourable options can be chosen at the same time.
It is often times visualized as a triangle where the available options are represented by vertices and
choices represented by edges. For example, in the world of international economics, the famous [impossible trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity)
states that among three possible policy positions: "free capical flow", "fixed exchange rate" and "sovereign monetary policy", a country can only take two
at the same time, as illustrated below.

Trilemmas exist across many disiplines and throughout history. 
In economics, other than the impossible trinity, there is also the [pinker social trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma#The_Pinker_social_trilemma)
which says that a society can not be "free", "fair" and "equal" simultaneously. In business, the [project management trillema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) argues that
one can only pick two out of "quick", "cheap" and "good" when a project is executed. In computing,
[CAP thereom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) suggests that for a distributed data store, "consistency", "availability" and "partition tolerance"
can not be achieved at the same time. In religion, [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Epicurus) logically challenges the existence of
an omnipotent and omnibenevelent god. The ubiquity of these statements begs the question: is there something fundamental about the trilemmas?

3 is a magic number in many cultures. It is a number that offers a sense of balance and completeness but is still brief enough to be memorized.
3 creates patterns that can be found in many speeches, slogans and concepts. From [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), [Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy),
and [Trias Politica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) to [Faster, Higher, Stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols), 
[Yes We Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign#Slogan) and Lincoln's [Government of the people, by the people, for the people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address).
In fact in writing, [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)) is pretty well researched and documented. When it comes to phrasing the
domain of a problem, there also seems to be a tendency to come up with three items in order to strike a balance between the level of completeness and the effectiveness
to convey the message. To some extent, this explains why we only see dilemmas and trilemmas but not "lemmas" with more options.

3 is also a number where things start to get more complicated. 

phrasing a problem into three aspects which are difficult to reconcile?

we have the [energy trillema](https://www.worldenergy.org/publications/entry/world-energy-trilemma-index-2019) and

rule of three

points:
1. three feel complete/brevity
2. three is the start of something more complex (three body problems)

another angle of looking at it
3. three is stable, if we can have it then it can be applied universally, we have a missing implicit edge
4. going backward

compromise. hard choices
complete has to contradict, overlap with each other.

Interacting with each other.

Two dimentional world. Triangles are the most stable shape, very rigid. Hard to achieve triangles, three
bodies problem is probably related to it.

in three dimentional space, all convex polyhedra are stable

1) political trilemma of the world economy
2) CAP thereom
3) Impossible trinity

If so, then Mr. Bloomberg would have plenty of company. Throughout
history and across disciplines, from the triple crown of horse racing
to the trilogy as bid for literary greatness, the No. 3 has
represented the pinnacle of achievement, the triple crème de la crème:
the Nile, the Tower of Pisa, the smile on the Mona Lisa.

事不过三

the two things forces the third thing to be impossible, because
together with the context, it is not a stable system.
context is not stable.

dilemma is an either/or situation, might be false dilemma (grey area)

Three-body problem is "the problem of taking the initial positions and
velocities of three point masses and solving for their subsequent
motion according to Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of
universal gravitation". Unlike two-body problem, no general
closed-form solution exists, as the resulting dynamical system is
chaotic for most initial conditions, and numerical methods are
generally required. 

what is the state of three body problem? what are the special cases
that are solved?

i can make the argument that two bodies problem is the two horn of the trelemma?


something is at the expense of something else. with the invisible
context. the fourth one actually make it not stable any more.


Trilemmas seems to be ubiquitous, 

When the present determines the future, but the approximate present
does not approximately determine the future. 

Why three? What about Dilemmas and Forlemmas? 4 bodies problem is even harder.

Is there always an invisible context? Are those "lemmas" just the tip
of an iceberg? Without the context, it is very hard to debate it. But
at the same time, those statement should be applied  in general,
meaning that a case by case examination is not really that great ....
are delimmas the conflict introduced by the lack of context and it's
urge to be applied universally?

Democracy, dictatorship, 

Applying a theory to reality, what should be taken into consideration?

Making a difficult choice.

- CAP Theorum
- Blockchain Trilemma
- Zizek trilemma
- Project management trilemma (Fast/Good/Cheap)
- The Pinker social trilemma (fair/free/equal)
- Impossible trinity

why balance, why Tao is kind of important? balance? chaotic system?

three bodies problem is much more difficult than two bodies problem,
what is the inner connection between pick 2 out of 3 in trillema?
