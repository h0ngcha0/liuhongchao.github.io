In [The Shawshank
Redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption),
[Brooks Hatlen](https://shawshank.fandom.com/wiki/Brooks_Hatlen) was
released from the prison after being locked up for 50 years. He
finally regained his liberty and yet his inability to adjust to the
outside world gives him constant fear and desperation. He commited
suicide. The freedom from the constraints of the prison killed
him. Similiarly, after [Booker
T. Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington) was
emancipated as a slave, his initial rejoicing was soon overwhelmed by
the sense of deep gloom due to the realization that without money,
education, skills and property, life is not significantly different
after their liberation.

Instead of drowning in desperation, Booker spent his life promoting
education, hard work and material prosperity among the
blacks. Ultimately, without a fairer access to education, health care,
security and other social rights, liberty would be an empty slogan for
a large portion of the population. However, enforcing those social
rights requires the redistribution of wealth and resources, therefore
inevitably infringing the liberty of other portion of the
population. The balance of this tension is one of the most important
topics in the debate between liberals and conservatives in
contemporary politics. 

One of the important questions to answer when discussing constraint
and liberty is **who are we optimizing for**. The goal of most of the
societies is to promote long term freedom and happiness of the
entire population. [Isaiah
Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Berlin) articulated in
his essay [Two Concepts of
Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Concepts_of_Liberty) about
the idea of [negative
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty) and [positive
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty) liberty. With only
negative liberty, which focuses primarily on the freedom from
interference by other people, the collective liberty and happiness can
neither be maximized nor fairly distributed. As a balancing force,
positive liberty emphathizes the importance of population's collective
capacity to act upon their free will, which can be adjusted by
enforcing certain constraints to the society. In this sense, negative
liberty alone constrains the society from reaching its full potential,
whereas proper constraints at the right level librate society at
large.

Constraint and liberty seem to have similiar dynamics at smaller scale
as well. For example, without the constraints of the rules, the game
of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) will not librate the
mind-blowing creativities from the players. The limited form of
expression offered by the likes of Tiktok, Twitter and WeChat seems to
have created more sticky networks and therefore more content. Often
times, less is more, constraint is liberty. This probably has to do
with our **limited mental capacity** as human beings. Constraints
abstract things away, sometimes at the expense of choice, but as a
tradeoff we get to focus our precious cognitive effort somewhere
else. This is not to say all constraints are well designed. Countless
games must have been invented throughout history, the set of
constraints Go offers stood the test of time.

Another example is programming languges. C is a great language for
system programming with very little constraints, but at the same time
it is also a double edged sword that can cut both ways. People who
mastered the language such as [Linus
Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) might feel
that [nothing is better than
C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYvJPra7Ebk). However, for many
programmers, having to worry about the countless traps and pitfalls of
C severely limits their capabilities to create. Many languages try to
fix this by enforcing different constraints. One example is functional
programming, where mutation of variables are strongly discouraged or even
disallowed. As it turns out, programmers' creativity are liberated by
these types of constraints because their cognative energy now be spent
more on solving the actual problems. In general, when we
are trying out different ways of working, we are applying different
constraints and see which one yields the best result. Liberty in the
context of work usually constrains our ability to perform.

Constraint and liberty are also **multifaceted**. Event at the
individual level, one freedom might come at the cost of another. The
constraint of being monitored by the surveillance camera might give
you the freedom to walk around safely at 2am anywhere in the city. The
unregulated freedom of speech in the age of information explosion
could significantly constrain your freedom to know the truth due to
the asymmetric cost to prove false information. Financial freedom at
certain age might require very displined life style and prudent
management of wealth at earlier age. The liberty to smoke many packs
of cigerettes a day might deprive of any other freedom you might have
the chance to enjoy prematurely.



Many people living in well functioning welfare states express similiar
feelings. Even though bigger portion of their wealth are redistributed
by the government, the peace of mind offered by the social security
benefits allow them to focus more on things that they care about. In
programming,



In contrast, many of us do not feel more free with the explosion of
information at our finger tip, we seems to be more constrained and
isolated. 


couple of things: 
- who are we talking about, 
- what constraints and what liberty?
- due to limitation, choice vs libraty
- multi faceted
who: scale + different people, mental limitation, multi faceted

limited capacity, multi dimentional

There is a vast tradeoff space when it comes to applying these
constraints. Different countries make different decisions based on
their respective history, culture, phase of development and many other
factors. The [Nordic
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) warefare system
works to a large extent in Scandinavia where there is popular support
for the constraints of high taxation (an infringement of negative
liberty for many) in exchange of a wild range of social benefits that
promotes the collective positive liberty. It is very difficult for
less developed countries or countries with cultures that focus more on
individiualism to replicate it successfully.




If it is ok to have political debate about the tradeoffs between
positive and negative liberty, what about the freedom of speech? Is
there a tradeoff space that can be made there?



There is a vast tradeoff space when applying this constraint. 

more postive liberty, which stresses the importance to pocess the
capacity to act upon one's free will.

It is only through In contrast, , as 
underlines the importance to pocess the capacity to act upon one's
free will. Without collectively putting a constraint to the society to
enable more positive liberty, 


Any governments will put a constraint to the society


In reality, the picture is much more complicated since

freedom and stability


is neither fairly
distributed nor collectively maximized. [Franklin
D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt)
famously proposed four fundamental freedoms that people everywhere in
the world ought to enjoy.

negative liberty and postiive liberty, we focus too much on negative liberty
postiive liberty requires constrains

without access to eduation, freedom is not evenly distributed and not
collectively maimized.

at what scale are we looking at things. individual or collection?
i think there are a lot of tension with individualism, especially with the current internet, blockchain and AI
technologies

constrains are added without consent, freedom becomes slogans

even at the individual level, liberties are multi-faceted

the ability to do something or is enabled to focus on something else due to mental capacities

the prison!! institutionalized

Commitment is a constraint (constraint system)
abstraction
a game of go
the swedish warefare system
functional programming (linus)

Multi-dimensional freedom <- freedom is not just one thing, sometimes it contradicts with each other
there are many freedom, it is an priority issue
fundamentally, we probably should understand freedom is not a monolith


Any kind of structure or rules that we put into place is a constraint
including Get Things Done

law is a constraint

communist party, is a constraint, free expression is a too much choice, we feel lost, we feel like shit

in his 1944 “Second Bill of Rights”address, FDR elaboratedthat allcitizenshave rights:
to a useful and remunerative job
to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothingand recreation to a decent home
to a good education
to adequate medical careand the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health
to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment

FDR, to be free is to live without (too much) government intervention
AND with the ability to actually pursue your own happiness


fundamental conflicts between individualism and collectivism <- liberty

bitcoin community talks a lot about positive liberty without
mentioning negative liberty

the existence of government infringines people's liberty (positive liberty)

The great disagreement between conservatives and liberals today often
boils down to a disagreement about what ‘freedom’ is.

About china, what are the other angle to look at it?

we are talking about different groups of people, and we are talking
about different freedom individually

redistribution of wealth is a tax, it buys long term stability

no redistribution would cause problems for the positive freedom as
well

sum total of liberty 

invidiualism + collectivism 
also individual mental capacity

even at the individual level they are contradicting with each other

the value of freedom

corvid

Liberty constains, constraint liberates
