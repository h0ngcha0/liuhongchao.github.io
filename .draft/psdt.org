Q: is PSBT still subject to a small set of possible scripts? whatever the output descriptor
can describe?

- goal: "allow people to pass around the same transaction to sign and combine their signatures."

- allow air-gapped or hardware wallet to sign without the access to UTXO sets.

- PSBT is a map or multiple maps?
