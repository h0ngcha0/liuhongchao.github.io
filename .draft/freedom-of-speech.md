Structure

- freedom of speech is very valuable
  crucial to advancement of humanity
  market place and battle field of ideas
  human desire, human right
  empowerment, and knowledge
  if there was someone who can decide the right info, that is fine,
  having a market place of ideas is an acknowledgement to this
  limitations
  owellian thought department is very bad
  
- information has property: assymetrical cost for verification
  free speech is never about being conforable, it is about being
  unconfortable, being challenged and constantly adapt.
  is this another case where humanity have invented something that
  ultimately exceeded our capacity?
  the quality of democracy is directly tied to the quality of the
  infomration. garbage in, garbage out.

  make analogy of market economy and free speech, market economy you
  have to put money where your action is, free speech is not.
  
  technology has bias, speech as a techology has bias as well. the
  question is do we have the ability to cope with this?

- money is information, action is an extention of information, why
  freedom of speech is ok? when freedom of money and freedom of action
  is not ok? perhaps speech is perceived as low impact, is the
  circumstances changing?
  
- there is so many ways of looking at the world, even though most what
  we want are pretty much the same, we still argue about things that
  only constitude very little of what we actually interact with. we
  just connect the dots differently. the cost is just too huge to have
  so many meaningless stuff going on.

- human have gone through periods of super advancements, but in large
  parts we are not going through periods of super advancement. freedom
  of speech is much more valuable in the periods of super advancement.

- if we look at this as a system, what is the spectrum? where should
  it be adjusted? is suppressing some ideas ok? or is the idea of
  controlling speech a taboo?
  
- facebook bad , use information as a way to make money make
  the qulaity of democracy worse.


freedom of speech is niux, it is what got us where we are today

freedom of speech always has a cost, reaching from one consensus to
another as a society is very expensive and society needs that.  why
freedom of speech seems to have failed that. 

information's property


then, spectrum of control and freedom, where should we do it?
depending on what context? when society needs consensus, more than
innovation, then maybe a suppression of freedom of speech is
better. otherwise it might not be as good. 

cryptography isnt allowed, and then it was expressed as freedom of speech.
