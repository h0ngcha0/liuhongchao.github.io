Instead, we discourage abnormal transactions by defining rules for
“standard” transactions. Standard transactions get accepted by
default-configured nodes and relayed to other nodes on the
network. Eventually, a standard transaction will reach a miner and end
up in a block.


Non-standard transactions, in contrast, will not be allowed in the
mempool of default-configured nodes, unless they’re included in a
block first.

Interesting.
