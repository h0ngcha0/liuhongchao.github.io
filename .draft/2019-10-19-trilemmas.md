Three-body problem is "the problem of taking the initial positions and
velocities of three point masses and solving for their subsequent
motion according to Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of
universal gravitation". Unlike two-body problem, no general
closed-form solution exists, as the resulting dynamical system is
chaotic for most initial conditions, and numerical methods are
generally required. 

what is the state of three body problem? what are the special cases
that are solved?

i can make the argument that two bodies problem is the two horn of the trelemma?

Trilemmas seems to be ubiquitous, 

When the present determines the future, but the approximate present
does not approximately determine the future. 

Why three? What about Dilemmas and Forlemmas? 4 bodies problem is even harder.

Is there always an invisible context? Are those "lemmas" just the tip
of an iceberg? Without the context, it is very hard to debate it. But
at the same time, those statement should be applied  in general,
meaning that a case by case examination is not really that great ....
are delimmas the conflict introduced by the lack of context and it's
urge to be applied universally?

Democracy, dictatorship, 

Applying a theory to reality, what should be taken into consideration?

Making a difficult choice.

- CAP Theorum
- Blockchain Trilemma
- Zizek trilemma
- Project management trilemma (Fast/Good/Cheap)
- The Pinker social trilemma (fair/free/equal)

why balance, why Tao is kind of important? balance? chaotic system?

three bodies problem is much more difficult than two bodies problem,
what is the inner connection between pick 2 out of 3 in trillema?
