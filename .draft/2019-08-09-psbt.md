title: PSBT - An Interchange Format for Bitcoin Wallets
---

**TL;DR**, To construct a [Multisig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature)
or [CoinJoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin) transaction, parties
involved need to collabrate by passing a unsigned or partially signed
transaction around until a valid transaction is constructed. With the
absense of standards, wallet software usually implement their own
format for "not fully signed" transaction and complement it with
ad-hoc protocols. This creates friction when different wallet software
are used during this process. The intention of [BIP-174: PSBT](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki) is
to offer such a standard so that wallets can work with each other in these
kind use cases.

### Benefits

One of the benefits is that signer does't have to have access to the UTXO set, it will have all the neccessary
information available to sign the transaction. good for air gapped wallet or hardware wallet.

the signer might not know how to satisfy the script if it is p2sh or p2wsh, for example. the script needs to be
provided by updater?

### Format
Maybe show some rusty code?

### Protocol
How different parties work with this format

### Example

use a real world example
