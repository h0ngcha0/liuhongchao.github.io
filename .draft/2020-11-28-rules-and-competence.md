title: The Perspective of Cost

Everything is associated with a cost. From goods and services to
relationships and fair societies, from time and cognition to running
any sort of organizations. The ubiquity of cost and the importance of
keeping it at bay [relative to the
benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit%E2%80%93cost_ratio)
means that cost can offer unique perspectives to help better
understand the world around us.

For example, rule of thumb can be viewed as a result of cost
optimization. By definition, it refers to principles with "broad
application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable
for every situation." Rule followers can hopefully have a higher
chance of achieving goals without incurring the cost of understanding
the intricacies of individual circumstances. However, rules that limit
more than they enable are probably bad cost optimization for the
situation. Seeing rules from the lens of cost help us to make concious
decisions about if it makes sense to follow them given the
requirements and resources at disposal.

Strategies also have different levels of cost. In [The Art of
War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War), Sun Tzu advised
that the greatest victory in war is one attained without fighting (不
战而屈人之兵) because war is the most expensive way of resolving
conflicts. In management, three R's (Retribution, Reciprocity and
Reason) is one way to categorize a leader's strategies of influence.
